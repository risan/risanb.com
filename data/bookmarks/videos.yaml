    title: The World's Most Dangerous Journey?
    description: The Darién Gap is a remote area between Colombia and Panama. Trechourus rivers, a dense rainforest,
      venomous snakes, drug traffickers. It's a dangerous place to cross. But many immigrants traverse this lawless land
      to reach the United States in hope of a better life.
